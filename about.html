        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am a college student trying to become a Full Stack Developer. I have yet to decide on a specific position I
          want. However, as of right now I am thinking of finishing the Coding BootCamp, and getting a degree in the medical
          field after. I would like to make a difference in the world, with the connection of technology and medical
          services.</p>
        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Orange County, California. To be more specific, I grew up in Westminster and Garden
          Grove.</p>
        <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <p>One of my pleasures is building and making stuff, whether its a bed to a scrapbook. I love the feeling of
          creating something, and feeling accomplished after.</p>
        <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>Aside from having the skills of a Full Stack Developer, my dream really is to make a positive change in the world
          with those skills.</p>
        <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>I still reside in Orange County, California.</p>
        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>My father told me when I was younger, that I should give Computer programming a chance, but I never did. Then one
          day in 2018, I decided to give it try. I tried to teach myself HTML & CSS. Little did I know, I would understand
          and enjoy it. I did my research, and found out about UCI's Coding BootCamp, and came to the realization I want to
          do this. It's like learning how to talk to a computer, and it incorporates algorithims. Which I love and hate.</p>
